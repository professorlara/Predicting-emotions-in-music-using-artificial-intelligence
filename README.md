# Predicting-emotions-in-music-using-artificial-intelligence
Code for the project 'Predicting emotion in music: Harnessing multimodal artificial intelligence to predict emotional dominance, valence and arousal'.

### Acoustic models: feature selection and grid search
- Acoustic Data Feature Selection.ipnyb
- Acoustic Data Grid Search Part 2.ipnyb (grid search for traditional model types )
- Acoustic Data Grid Search Part 3.ipnyb (grid search for neural networks types)

### Language models: feature selection and grid search

### Ensemble/multimodal models


The code in the notebooks mentioned above was repeated for the dominance, valence and arousal labels. Instead of uploading the same files three times, I have only uploaded the notebooks for the dominance label.
